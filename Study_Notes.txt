Node.js
  Purpose : The runtime environment for Javascript.

Dependencies (Command npm install) :
  1. Express
    Purpose : Framework for Node.js for creating Web Application. Establishes server?
  2. Mongoose
    Purpose : Library that simplifies commands for using MongoDB, such as connecting to the DB.
  3. Body Parser
    Purpose : When the client puts together a bunch of info and throws that at the server, there needs
    to be some way to reorganize that and make it into a req.body. Body parser achieves that
    
External Resources :
  1. Postman
    Purpose : Used for testing when the server is established, but the client isn't. In this case,
    there's not a good way to find out if the DB addition actually succeeded or not, so we use
    Postman to receive details on success or failure.
