React.js
  Purpose : Frontend framework.

Concepts:
    1. Real DOM vs. Virtual DOM (Document Object Model)
        : Virtual DOM only has to reload items that have been updated / changed.
    2. Webpack
        : combines complex modules(due to modern websites being very complex) into simple HTML, CSS & JS
          Pictures should be placed under the /src folder for the webpack to do its job, not the public
          file.
    3. npm vs. npx
        : NPM = Node Package Manager. A command line utility for interacting with package installations,
          version management, and dependency managements. The package.json file summarizes all of what
          npm does. Most packages are downloaded locally into node_modules.
          NPX = Borrowing stuff in Node without having to download globally to the local machine.
          Disk space saved, and we use the latest version.
    4. CORS(Cross Origin Resource Sharing) Issue, Proxy Solution
        : If the backend server & the frontend are using different ports, i.e. 3000 vs 5000, then
          requests cannot be sent to each other without special settings.
          How to solve ?
          Set the Proxy manually. See section 4 in Dependencies & Libraries

Grammar:
    1. Import
        1.1 Must import React from 'react';
        1.2 Must import Router DOM by
        import {
            BrowserRouter as Router,
            Switch,
            Route,
            Link
        } from "react-router-dom";
    2. Router
        2.1 When using <Route ... component={ ... } />, must specify with 'exact path'


Dependencies & Libraries :
    1. Downloading (Kind of) React
        Command : npx create-react-app .
    2. Turning on the React App
        Command : npm run start
    3. React Router DOM
        Command : npm react-router-dom --save & import the package
    4. Axios
        Command : npm install axios --save
        Purpose : Neccessary when sending requests to the server / DB thru React
    5. Proxy Middleware
        Command : npm install http-proxy-middleware --save
                  Then, create setupProxy.js in the src file.
                  In the setupProxy file, specify which port number to set proxy to.
        Purpose :
    

React App Structure :
    Ex) In index.js => <React.StrictMode><App /></React.StrictMode>, document.getElementById('root')
    We get the element that has the Id 'root', and show <App/> on that element.
