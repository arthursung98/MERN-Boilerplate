React.js
  Purpose : Frontend framework.

Concepts:
    1. Real DOM vs. Virtual DOM (Document Object Model)
        : Virtual DOM only has to reload items that have been updated / changed.
    2. Webpack
        : combines complex modules(due to modern websites being very complex) into simple HTML, CSS & JS
          Pictures should be placed under the /src folder for the webpack to do its job, not the public
          file.
    3. npm vs. npx
        : NPM = Node Package Manager. A command line utility for interacting with package installations,
          version management, and dependency managements. The package.json file summarizes all of what
          npm does. Most packages are downloaded locally into node_modules.
          NPX = Borrowing stuff in Node without having to download globally to the local machine.
          Disk space saved, and we use the latest version.

Dependencies & Libraries :
    1. Downloading React
        Command : npx create-react-app .
    2. Turning on the React App
        Command : npm run start


External Resources :

React App Structure :
    Ex) In index.js => <React.StrictMode><App /></React.StrictMode>, document.getElementById('root')
    We get the element that has the Id 'root', and show <App/> on that element.
